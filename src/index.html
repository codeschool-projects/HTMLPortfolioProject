      <h3>Learn More About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Two years ago, I invested in the Dev Bootcamp (DBC) experience which was one of the hardest things I've had to do in my life. It has re-wired my brain for accelerated learning. I am now confident in saying that I can pick up any programming language quickly. It has allowed me to develop a comprehensive understanding of: Ruby on Rails, Javascript, pairing, and engineering empathy. Through the experience I learned to leverage my strong problem solving abilities, particularly pseudo-coding, design patterns, and best practices.
